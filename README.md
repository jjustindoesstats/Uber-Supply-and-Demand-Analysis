# Uber-Supply-and-Demand-Analysis
Analyzing and Querying Uber supply and demand data to answer key buisness questions.  Queries done in MySQL and plots/data visualization done in Tableau
Used Querying and data visualization to answer questions like:
True or False: Driver supply always increases when demand increases during the two week period
What was the highest number of completed trips within a 24 hour period?
etc
Created a dashboard to tell a story about Uber's customer acquistion issues.  Used results to propose new buisness questions and potential investigations.
